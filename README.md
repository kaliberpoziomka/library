## Library

The goal of this project was to make a library using object constructor.
In this project I learned:
- how to use object contructors
- how to dynamically add HTML to DOM
- how to use localStorage

The biggest issues I had in this project:
- adding close div event to dynamically created divs (ended up with onclick())
- using local storage

Project made thanks to https://www.theodinproject.com/
